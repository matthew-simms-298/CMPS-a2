## Part A: Problem Definition and Requirements

### Problem Statement

Our system is a smart notification system that will send personalized notifications to users based on the following criteria. The notifications that will be sent to the user of this system will be based on their authentication status (is logged in?), their role in the system (admin, editor, viewer), subscriptionstatus (active or inactive), and the permissions that the user has set. The permissions are the list of allowed notfications for that specific user.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

- Authenticate user
- Check user role
- Verify subscription type and status
- Retrieve user permissions
- Send personalized notifications based on the above criteria

#### Non-Functional Requirements

- System should handle multiple users simultaneously
- Notifications sent in a timely manner

## Part B: Data Structure and Organization

### Data Structures Used

- Dictionary list
  - Store Users
    - User Data
- Boolean
- String

## Data Types Table

### Data Types Table

| Name            | Data Type | Constraints | Description                    |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| isAuthenticated | Boolean   | None        | Indicates if user is logged in |

### List (Specific)

#### User Dictionary (List of Dictionaries)

| Name               | Data Type     | Constraints                | Description                      |
| ------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| userID             | String        | Unique                     | Unique identifier for each user  |
| userPassword       | String        | Non-empty                  | Password for user authentication |
| name               | String        | Non-empty                  | Name of the user                 |
| email              | String        | Valid email format         | Email address of the user        |
| phoneNumber        | String        | Valid phone number format  | Phone number of the user         |
| userRole           | String        | [admin, editor, viewer]    | Role of the user                 |
| subscriptionStatus | Boolean       | Active (1), Not Active (0) | Status of subscription           |
| userPermissions    | List, Boolean | Non-empty                  | List of permissions for user     |

#### Permission List (List of Booleans)

| Name               | Default Value | Description                                | index |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| inAppNotifications | True          | Permission to receive in-app notifications | 0     |
| pushNotifications  | False         | Permission to receive push notifications   | 1     |
| emailNotifications | False         | Permission to receive email notifications  | 2     |
| smsNotifications   | False         | Permission to receive SMS notifications    | 3     |

## Part C: Logic Design

### Truth Table:

| Logged In | Role | Subscribed | Notification |
| --------- | ---- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1         | 1    | 1          | 1            |
| 1         | 1    | 0          | 0            |
| 1         | 0    | 1          | 0            |
| 0         | 1    | 1          | 0            |
| 1         | 0    | 0          | 0            |
| 0         | 1    | 0          | 0            |
| 0         | 0    | 1          | 0            |
| 0         | 0    | 0          | 0            |

Table Guide:
Logged In: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
Role: 1 = True, 0 = False
Subscribed: 1 = True, 0 = False
